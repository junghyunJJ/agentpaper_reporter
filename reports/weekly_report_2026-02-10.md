<summary>Abstract</summary>

ALS shows marked clinical heterogeneity, yet much real-world evidence remains trapped in unstructured reports. Here we introduce MEDSTREM, a large-language-model (LLM)-based agent that converts patient-sourced document images into standardized longitudinal electronic health records, enabling bottom-up cohort building and linkage to trials and multi-omics. By applying MEDSTREM to clinical report images from 8,298 individuals collected via AskHelpU and harmonizing with PRO-ACT and Answer ALS, we generated 17,602 standardized records and multi-omics profiles from 940 induced motor neuron lines. Progression modelling resolved five subtypes and a continuous degeneration score with interpretable anchors: hand-grip strength and forced vital capacity tracked functional loss, and malnutrition emerged as a modifiable correlate. Across RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, clinical severity is aligned with suppression of cell-cycle programmes, declining histone-gene activity and genome-wide chromatin opening, suggesting distinct epigenetic trajectories. These findings establish an agentic AI framework that turns unstructured clinical records into mechanistic insight and links them to multi-omics, reframing ALS studies from top-down, trial-centric analyses to a bottom-up, patient-sourced approach that reveals actionable heterogeneity.

> The paper presents a prospective pilot study evaluating the safety and utility of MedAgentBrief, an agentic AI system based on a large language model (LLM) for generating hospital course summaries. Conducted with 11 attending hospitalist physicians, the study found that the AI-generated summaries were used in 57% of cases with minimal reported harm, despite some inaccuracies and omissions. Importantly, the intervention significantly reduced clinician burnout and showed potential for lessening documentation time, highlighting its promising role in alleviating the burdens of clinical documentation through AI support.


<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

ImportanceHigh-quality discharge summaries are essential for safe care transitions but contribute substantially to clinician documentation burden and burnout. While retrospective studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can generate clinical summaries of comparable quality to physicians, prospective data on their safety, utility, and impact on clinician well-being in real-world environments are lacking.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the safety, utilization, and impact on clinician burden of MedAgentBrief, an LLM-based agentic workflow for generating hospital course summaries, during prospective clinical deployment.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsSingle-arm prospective pilot study of 11 attending hospitalist physicians at one inpatient unit from August 1 to October 11, 2025, with baseline comparisons drawn from April 9 to July 31, 2025.

InterventionMedAgentBrief, a custom agentic AI workflow utilizing Gemini 2.5 Pro, generated draft hospital course summaries nightly using the patients history and physical and daily progress notes. Drafts were securely emailed to physicians daily for review and optional use.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was physician-reported potential for and severity of harm from unedited summaries (AHRQ Common Format Harm Scale). Secondary outcomes included utilization rate, error types (omissions, inaccuracies, hallucinations), time spent in discharge summaries (EHR logs), and changes in cognitive burden (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]) and burnout (Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index [PFI] Work Exhaustion Scale).

ResultsThe system generated 1274 summaries. Of 384 discharges, physicians utilized AI content in 219 (57%) cases. Feedback on 100 summaries (40.2%) noted omissions (25%) and inaccuracies (20%) but rare hallucinations (2%). Physicians rated 88% of unedited summaries as having no harm potential and 1% as likely to cause moderate harm; no severe harm was reported. Physician burnout scores decreased significantly (1.75 vs 1.20; P = .03). Time savings were heterogeneous: 71% of physicians saw reductions in median documentation time (up to 2.9 minutes).

Conclusions and RelevanceAn LLM-based agentic workflow produced hospital course summaries that were frequently utilized with mild to minimal risk of harm identified. The intervention was associated with a significant reduction in physician burnout, supporting the viability of AI summarization to mitigate documentation burden.

> The paper presents a knowledge-grounded framework for analyzing drug safety cases, which integrates disproportionality analysis and introduces a hallucination-risk-aware execution planner to enhance causal reasoning and interpretability in pharmacovigilance. The methodology emphasizes deterministic graph retrieval over generative approaches to mitigate risks when dealing with clinically sensitive information. Key findings reveal that this approach effectively reduces case processing time while promoting reliable and explainable evidence assessment, with potential extensions for more advanced causal inference capabilities in agentic AI systems.


<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

In pharmacovigilance, analyzing drug safety cases is often time consuming due to the abundance of laboratory data, complex medical histories, and intricate temporal relationships. Agentic AI systems can significantly reduce case processing time by assisting medical reviewers in surfacing clinically relevant evidence. However, previous studies have highlighted that large language models alone lack causal reasoning and evidence-based interpretability.

To address these limitations, we present a knowledge-grounded safety case analysis framework that integrates disproportionality analysis to generate and prioritize potential adverse event hypotheses. Crucially, we introduce a novel hallucination-risk-aware execution planner that dynamically routes queries to the safest reasoning pathway, prioritizing deterministic graph retrieval over generative methods for clinically sensitive signals. The system demonstrates how structured medical knowledge and statistical evidence can be combined to support a reliable, explainable case assessment and can be readily extended with causal inference modules for deeper clinical reasoning.

- **Categories:** ophthalmology


> The paper investigates the effectiveness of generalist vision-language models (VLMs) versus autonomous AI agents in detecting subtle warning signs during cataract surgery by analyzing 537 surgical video clips. Utilizing a multicenter dataset, the study compared the performance of VLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings against classifiers produced by AI agents that were tailored for specific tasks. The findings indicated that AI-generated classifiers significantly outperformed VLMs, achieving an F1-score of 0.869 compared to the best VLM score of 0.519, thus demonstrating that agent-driven supervised modeling is more effective for precise intraoperative video analysis.


<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

ImportanceVision-language models (VLMs) enable generalist multimodal reasoning, but their ability to resolve brief, low-contrast cues in surgical video without task-specific training is uncertain. Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents offer an alternative paradigm by autonomously generating supervised classifiers tailored to specific visual tasks.

ObjectiveTo benchmark the performance of VLMs against supervised classifiers engineered by autonomous AI agents for detecting anterior capsular radial folds during continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), and to compare both approaches with human graders.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis retrospective diagnostic study utilized a multicenter dataset of 537 CCC videos collected from Beijing Tongren Hospital (China), National University Hospital (Singapore), and the OphNet-APTOS public dataset.

ExposurePresence or absence of anterior capsular radial folds during CCC, defined based on established expert consensus, was annotated at both clip and frame levels by senior glaucoma surgeons. Two analytic paradigms were evaluated: (1) direct zero-shot and few-shot inference using 11 generalist and medical-specific VLMs on single frames and frame sequences; and (2) autonomous code generation by 4 AI agents to construct supervised image classifiers from labeled frames. Human comparison included 7 graders with varying levels of ophthalmic experience.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresDiscrimination of fold-positive versus fold-negative cases was assessed using macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score at the clip and frame levels. Secondary outcomes included comparisons with human graders.

ResultsAmong 537 video clips (7.32 {+/-} 3.35 seconds), 156 (29.1%) were fold-positive. VLM performance was limited; the top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL, achieved a mean F1-score of 0.519. Few-shot prompting improved GPT-4.1 performance (mean F1-score from 0.177 to 0.480) but remained unstable. In contrast, an agent-engineered classifier achieved an F1-score of 0.869 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958. In comparison with human graders, the top agent-generated model (F1-score, 0.835) matched junior specialists (mean F1-score, 0.829), whereas fine-tuned VLMs (maximum F1-score, 0.606) underperformed all human graders.

Conclusions and RelevanceGeneralist VLMs showed limited capacity to detect subtle intraoperative cues, whereas autonomous AI agents successfully constructed task-specific classifiers with near-clinical-level performance. These findings support agent-driven supervised modeling as a more effective strategy for fine-grained surgical video interpretation.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow do generalist vision-language models (VLMs) and autonomous AI agents compare with human graders in detecting brief, low-contrast intraoperative cues in surgical video?

FindingsIn this retrospective, multicenter diagnostic benchmarking study of 537 phacoemulsification video clips, VLMs showed limited discrimination of anterior capsular radial folds, even with few-shot prompting, whereas autonomous AI agents successfully generated supervised classifiers with substantially higher performance, approaching that of junior glaucoma specialists.

MeaningFor fine-grained intraoperative video interpretation, task-specific classifiers engineered by autonomous agents currently demonstrate greater clinical relevance than generalist VLMs.

Progression modelling resolved five subtypes and a continuous degeneration score with interpretable anchors: hand-grip strength and forced vital capacity tracked functional loss, and malnutrition emerged as a modifiable correlate. Across RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, clinical severity is aligned with suppression of cell-cycle programmes, declining histone-gene activity and genome-wide chromatin opening, suggesting distinct epigenetic trajectories. These findings establish an agentic AI framework that turns unstructured clinical records into mechanistic insight and links them to multi-omics, reframing ALS studies from top-down, trial-centric analyses to a bottom-up, patient-sourced approach that reveals actionable heterogeneity.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

ImportanceHigh-quality discharge summaries are essential for safe care transitions but contribute substantially to clinician documentation burden and burnout. While retrospective studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can generate clinical summaries of comparable quality to physicians, prospective data on their safety, utility, and impact on clinician well-being in real-world environments are lacking.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the safety, utilization, and impact on clinician burden of MedAgentBrief, an LLM-based agentic workflow for generating hospital course summaries, during prospective clinical deployment.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsSingle-arm prospective pilot study of 11 attending hospitalist physicians at one inpatient unit from August 1 to October 11, 2025, with baseline comparisons drawn from April 9 to July 31, 2025.

InterventionMedAgentBrief, a custom agentic AI workflow utilizing Gemini 2.5 Pro, generated draft hospital course summaries nightly using the patients history and physical and daily progress notes. Drafts were securely emailed to physicians daily for review and optional use.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was physician-reported potential for and severity of harm from unedited summaries (AHRQ Common Format Harm Scale). Secondary outcomes included utilization rate, error types (omissions, inaccuracies, hallucinations), time spent in discharge summaries (EHR logs), and changes in cognitive burden (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]) and burnout (Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index [PFI] Work Exhaustion Scale).

ResultsThe system generated 1274 summaries. Of 384 discharges, physicians utilized AI content in 219 (57%) cases. Feedback on 100 summaries (40.2%) noted omissions (25%) and inaccuracies (20%) but rare hallucinations (2%). Physicians rated 88% of unedited summaries as having no harm potential and 1% as likely to cause moderate harm; no severe harm was reported. Physician burnout scores decreased significantly (1.75 vs 1.20; P = .03). Time savings were heterogeneous: 71% of physicians saw reductions in median documentation time (up to 2.9 minutes).

Conclusions and RelevanceAn LLM-based agentic workflow produced hospital course summaries that were frequently utilized with mild to minimal risk of harm identified. The intervention was associated with a significant reduction in physician burnout, supporting the viability of AI summarization to mitigate documentation burden.

> The paper presents a knowledge-grounded framework for analyzing drug safety cases, which integrates disproportionality analysis and introduces a hallucination-risk-aware execution planner to enhance causal reasoning and interpretability in pharmacovigilance. The methodology emphasizes deterministic graph retrieval over generative approaches to mitigate risks when dealing with clinically sensitive information. Key findings reveal that this approach effectively reduces case processing time while promoting reliable and explainable evidence assessment, with potential extensions for more advanced causal inference capabilities in agentic AI systems.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

In pharmacovigilance, analyzing drug safety cases is often time consuming due to the abundance of laboratory data, complex medical histories, and intricate temporal relationships. Agentic AI systems can significantly reduce case processing time by assisting medical reviewers in surfacing clinically relevant evidence. However, previous studies have highlighted that large language models alone lack causal reasoning and evidence-based interpretability.

To address these limitations, we present a knowledge-grounded safety case analysis framework that integrates disproportionality analysis to generate and prioritize potential adverse event hypotheses. Crucially, we introduce a novel hallucination-risk-aware execution planner that dynamically routes queries to the safest reasoning pathway, prioritizing deterministic graph retrieval over generative methods for clinically sensitive signals. The system demonstrates how structured medical knowledge and statistical evidence can be combined to support a reliable, explainable case assessment and can be readily extended with causal inference modules for deeper clinical reasoning.

> The paper investigates the effectiveness of generalist vision-language models (VLMs) versus autonomous AI agents in detecting subtle warning signs during cataract surgery by analyzing 537 surgical video clips. Utilizing a multicenter dataset, the study compared the performance of VLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings against classifiers produced by AI agents that were tailored for specific tasks. The findings indicated that AI-generated classifiers significantly outperformed VLMs, achieving an F1-score of 0.869 compared to the best VLM score of 0.519, thus demonstrating that agent-driven supervised modeling is more effective for precise intraoperative video analysis.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

ImportanceVision-language models (VLMs) enable generalist multimodal reasoning, but their ability to resolve brief, low-contrast cues in surgical video without task-specific training is uncertain. Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents offer an alternative paradigm by autonomously generating supervised classifiers tailored to specific visual tasks.

ObjectiveTo benchmark the performance of VLMs against supervised classifiers engineered by autonomous AI agents for detecting anterior capsular radial folds during continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), and to compare both approaches with human graders.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis retrospective diagnostic study utilized a multicenter dataset of 537 CCC videos collected from Beijing Tongren Hospital (China), National University Hospital (Singapore), and the OphNet-APTOS public dataset.

ExposurePresence or absence of anterior capsular radial folds during CCC, defined based on established expert consensus, was annotated at both clip and frame levels by senior glaucoma surgeons. Two analytic paradigms were evaluated: (1) direct zero-shot and few-shot inference using 11 generalist and medical-specific VLMs on single frames and frame sequences; and (2) autonomous code generation by 4 AI agents to construct supervised image classifiers from labeled frames. Human comparison included 7 graders with varying levels of ophthalmic experience.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresDiscrimination of fold-positive versus fold-negative cases was assessed using macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score at the clip and frame levels. Secondary outcomes included comparisons with human graders.

ResultsAmong 537 video clips (7.32 {+/-} 3.35 seconds), 156 (29.1%) were fold-positive. VLM performance was limited; the top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL, achieved a mean F1-score of 0.519. Few-shot prompting improved GPT-4.1 performance (mean F1-score from 0.177 to 0.480) but remained unstable. In contrast, an agent-engineered classifier achieved an F1-score of 0.869 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958. In comparison with human graders, the top agent-generated model (F1-score, 0.835) matched junior specialists (mean F1-score, 0.829), whereas fine-tuned VLMs (maximum F1-score, 0.606) underperformed all human graders.

Conclusions and RelevanceGeneralist VLMs showed limited capacity to detect subtle intraoperative cues, whereas autonomous AI agents successfully constructed task-specific classifiers with near-clinical-level performance. These findings support agent-driven supervised modeling as a more effective strategy for fine-grained surgical video interpretation.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow do generalist vision-language models (VLMs) and autonomous AI agents compare with human graders in detecting brief, low-contrast intraoperative cues in surgical video?

FindingsIn this retrospective, multicenter diagnostic benchmarking study of 537 phacoemulsification video clips, VLMs showed limited discrimination of anterior capsular radial folds, even with few-shot prompting, whereas autonomous AI agents successfully generated supervised classifiers with substantially higher performance, approaching that of junior glaucoma specialists.

MeaningFor fine-grained intraoperative video interpretation, task-specific classifiers engineered by autonomous agents currently demonstrate greater clinical relevance than generalist VLMs.
